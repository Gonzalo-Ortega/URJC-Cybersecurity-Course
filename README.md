# Ciphers seen in Cybersecurity Course
#### 🏛️ Imparted in Universidad Rey Juan Carlos during 2023 for the Software Engeneering degree.
Python implementations of different classic and modern ciphers used to 
solve some problems proposed during the course.

The repostoriy include three manual implementations of simple ciphers:
1. The Cesar's cipher.
2. The Vigenere's cipher.
3. The XOR cipher.

And two implementations using Python libraries of more advance ciphers:
1. The Base64 cipher.
2. The AES cipher.
